# icon-editor-2016
[//]: # (Description)
Created in 2016 during my web programming studies, this web allows users to draw an 32x32px icon, with different options and tools. The preview is displayed in a canvas, so you can right-click it to save it as an icon. The web icon was created using the same website.
